üöó**Acko Car Data Analysis**

**Project Overview**

This project involves web scraping car data from the Acko Cars website, followed by data analysis to derive insights into factors like engine power, mileage, price trends, and brand reputation across different states in India. The goal is to understand pricing patterns and key determinants affecting car valuations.

**Tech Stack üõ†Ô∏è**

*Programming Language*: Python

*Web Scraping*: BeautifulSoup, Requests

*Data Processing*: Pandas, NumPy

*Data Visualization*: Matplotlib, Seaborn

*Jupyter Notebook*: For interactive data analysis


**Metadata for Columns:**


*Brand:* The manufacturer of the car (e.g., Audi, BMW, Maruti Suzuki)

*Model:* The specific model name of the car (e.g., Q5, X5, Swift)

*Variant:* The trim level or version of the car model (e.g., Sport, Limited, LXI)

*Body:* The body type of the car (e.g., SUV, Sedan, Hatchback)

*Fuel:* The type of fuel the car uses (e.g., Petrol, Diesel, Electric, CNG)

*Transmission:* The type of transmission system (e.g., Manual, Automatic, CVT)

*Mileage:* The fuel efficiency of the car in km/l or km per charge

*Engine Power:* The power output of the engine measured in bhp or kW

*Price:* The cost of the car in INR



üìä**Data Analysis:**

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Identified missing values, outliers, and correlations between different features.

**Feature Engineering**: Cleaned and transformed data for better insights.

**Statistical Analysis**: Performed trend analysis on car prices based on attributes like engine power, brand, and location.



üìà**Visualizations:**

Distribution of car prices and mileage
Brand-wise average pricing
Heatmaps for correlation between numerical features
State-wise car price variations



üí°**Future Enhancements**

Automating data scraping at regular intervals to track price changes.
Implementing machine learning models to predict car prices based on historical data.
Deploying an interactive dashboard to visualize insights in real-time.

**Conclusion**

This project provides valuable insights into car pricing trends using web scraping and data analysis techniques. Future iterations may involve predictive modeling and real-time data updates to enhance accuracy and usability.
